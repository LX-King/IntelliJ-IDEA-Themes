# IntelliJ IDEA Themes

This is a collection of themes that can be used with IntelliJ idea.  The theming system has mostly been unchanged except for some additions over the years so these themes should be usable back to IDEA version 7. 

## Installation

Add these files to your colors settings directory.  On OSX, this should be under $USER_HOME/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea10/colors.  On Windows, this should be under $USER_HOME/.IntelliJIdea10/config/colors.

## Notes

Most of these themes revolve around languages I work with on a daily basis.  If you are using some of the more esoteric languages supported by IDEA, you may not have proper highlighting in their respective files.  Also, a font in a theme may or may not be available on your platform in which case IDEA will default to something else; typically, any monospace font is an acceptable replacement.
